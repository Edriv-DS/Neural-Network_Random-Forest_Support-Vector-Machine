# Neural-Network_Random-Forest_Support-Vector-Machine
Collect the datasets you received load it using pandas  . <br> Apply necessary pre-processing steps on it  . <br>Support Vector Machine (SVM), Neural Network (Multilayer Perceptron Classifier) and Random Forest are three very popular machine learning classifiers.<br> Divide the dataset into 8:2 train-test split and perform Support Vector Machine, Neural Network (MLPClassifier) and Random Forest on it using sklearn library .<br> Perform dimensionality reduction using PCA. Reduce the number of feature vectors into half (e.g. if your dataset has 10 columns, after applying PCA it should have 5 columns)  .<br> Apply Support Vector Machine, Neural Network (MLPClassifier) and Random Forest again on the reduced dataset.<br>  Compare the accuracy of the pre-PCA and post-PCA results. Plot them against each other in a bar graph.
